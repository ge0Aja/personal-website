<div class="my-6">
  Hello! My name is Georgi<br/>
  I'm a Software Engineer working <a href="https://www.criteo.com/">@ Criteo</a> - an AdTech company based in Paris, France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>Short History</h2>
  After graduating from Aleppo University - faculty of Informatics, Aleppo, Syria in 2014, I was accepted in a master's program in Computer Engineering @ <a href="https://aub.edu.lb/msfea/Pages/default.aspx">Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering | American University of Beirut</a> <br/>
  I was part of the Networking & Security research group lead by a group of professors from the computer engineering depratement. My advisor was Prof. Ali Chehab.<br/>
  We worked on several research projects covering several domains such as:

  <ul style="padding-left:30px">
    <li>Cryptography</li>
    <li>Mobile Security</li>
    <li>Network Security</li>
    <li>Software Defined Networking (SDN)</li>
    <li>Machine Learning (ML)</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  I've spent around 2.5 years @ AUB durig which I took different courses covernig topics in ML, Networking, Security, and Telecom.
  I was working as a graduate/research assistant where I helped maintaining and developing internal websites that were used by the department to manage students.
  Finally, I was able to publish a couple of research papers that were developed during the courses covered by the program. Additionally, I collaborated with some colleagues by working on a crowdsourcing mobile app to rate 3rd party applications behavior - See <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7073247?reload=true&arnumber=7073247">here</a> for the full story.
  I also have an accepted journal article that was published in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Chehab2/publication/320139047_Mobile_Apps_identification_based_on_network_flows/links/5af130940f7e9ba366452fbf/Mobile-Apps-identification-based-on-network-flows.pdf">Springer - Knowledge and Information Systems</a><br/>

  <h3>Thesis</h3>
  As a partial requirement to graduate from the master's program I wrote my thesis about Mobile Network Classification - See full print <a href="http://scholarworks.aub.edu.lb/bitstream/handle/10938/20966/et-6590.pdf?sequence=1">here</a>.<br/>
  I tried to provide a solution using a classification engine based on ML algorithms to classify and detect abnormal network traffic generated by mobile applications.
  The classification engine used supervised and semi-supervised ML classification models to detect abnormal traffic. The main contributions of the thesis are:
    <ul style="padding-left:30px">
      <li>Vector of network features used to feed the model</li>
      <li>Comparison between different classification models</li>
      <li>Formulation of a similarity score used in a Bayesian probability algorithm to differeniate traffic patterns</li>
    </ul>

<br/>

After graduation, I stayed in Beirut for a period of 6 months where I worked as a freelancer - full stack developer for a local company. The development suite was mainly in .Net/C# and MSSQL.<br/>
During my free time I tried several ideas of projects that used ML models such as object detection and sign language interpretation using Deep Learning.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Coming to France</h2>
In mid 2018 I accepted a short term job offer in Paris Sud XI university in the south of Paris to work as a research engineer for 6 months.
I was assigned to work on a project called <a href="https://www.eitdigital.eu/newsroom/news/archive/article/approximction-creates-new-standard-for-ultra-low-energy-wireless-sensor-nodes/">Approxim@ction</a> related to IoT networks. The main idea was to design and Implment a security layer to exchange data between IoT network nodes. The security layer used key Diffieâ€“Hellman exchange mechanism to establish a shared secret and cipher network messages between the nodes and the sink.<br/><br/>
After a successful project delivery, I was assigned to another project called <b>Augmented Retail</b> in a slightly different domain. Working with a team from SAP to create a retail product identification tool using DL models to help retail employees in everyday work.
The tool used pre-trained models wrapped in a Python webservice to recognize everyday retail objects sent from mobile phones cameras - See <a href="https://github.com/ge0Aja/globus_web_app">here</a> for the sourcecode.<br/><br/>

<h3>Finally with Criteo</h3>
Starting 2020 I accepted a job offer to work as a software development engineer at Criteo. Since then, I've experienced development cases in many parts of Criteo stack. The main assignments I work on include:
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
  <li>Datapipeline development using Scala Spark / Hadoop</li>
  <li>Offline jobs development using inhouse tools e.g. <a href="https://github.com/criteo/cuttle">Cuttle</a></li>
  <li>C# & .Netcore development</li>
  <li>Data Analysis using Python & Jupyter notebooks</li>
  <li>Monitoring and metrics logging with Prometheus & Grafana</li>
  <li>Large Scale solutions design & architecture</li>
</ul>
