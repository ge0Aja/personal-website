<div class="my-6">
  Hello! My name is Georgi<br/>
  I'm a Software Engineer working <a href="https://www.criteo.com/">@Criteo</a> - an AdTech company based in Paris, France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>Short History</h2>
  After graduating from Aleppo University, Aleppo, Syria in 2014, I was accepted in a master's program @ <a href="https://aub.edu.lb/msfea/Pages/default.aspx">Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering | American University of Beirut</a> <br/>
  I was part of the Networking & Security research group lead by a group of professors from the computer engineering depratement. My advisor was Prof. Ali Chehab.<br/>
  We worked on several research projects covering several domains such as

  <ul style="padding-left:30px">
    <li>Cryptography</li>
    <li>Mobile Security</li>
    <li>Network Security</li>
    <li>Software Defined Networking (SDN)</li>
    <li>Machine Learning (ML)</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  I've spent around 2.5 years @ AUB durig which I took different courses covernig topics in ML, Networking, Security, and Telecom.
  I was working as a graduate/research assistant where I helped maintaining and developing internal websites that were used by the department to manage students.
  Finally, I was able to publish a couple of research papers that were the developed as part of the courses covered by the program.
  I also have an accepted journal article that was published in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Chehab2/publication/320139047_Mobile_Apps_identification_based_on_network_flows/links/5af130940f7e9ba366452fbf/Mobile-Apps-identification-based-on-network-flows.pdf">Springer - Knowledge and Information Systems</a><br/><br/>

  <h3>My Thesis</h3>
  As a partial requirement to graduate from the master's program I wrote my thesis about Mobile Network Classification - See full print <a href="http://scholarworks.aub.edu.lb/bitstream/handle/10938/20966/et-6590.pdf?sequence=1">here</a>.<br/>
  I tried to provide a solution using a classification engine based on ML algorithms to classify and detect abnormal network traffic generated by mobile applications.
  The classification engine used supervised and semi-supervised ML classification models to detect abnormal traffic. The main contributions of the thesis are:
    <ul style="padding-left:30px">
      <li>Vector of network features used to feed the model</li>
      <li>Comparison between different classification models</li>
      <li>Formulation of a similarity score used in a Bayesian probability algorithm to differeniate traffic patterns</li>
    </ul>

<br/>

After graduation, I stayed in Beirut for a period of 6 months where I worked as a freelancer - full stack developer for a local company. The development suit was mainly in .Net/C# and MSSQL.<br/>
During my free time I tried several ideas of projects that used ML models such as object detection and sign language interpretation using Deep Learning.
